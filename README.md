# Applied_Data_Science_Capstone

I followed IBM Data Science Professional Certificate through Coursera. As its capstone project, I predicted the success of a future SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets landing process. I used SpaceX API and Web Scraping to collet data for this project. Then I proformed a explotary data analicis using pandas library and SQL . Then I visualize data using matplotlib and seaborn. Folium was used to makea interactive maps and Plotly Dash was used to built interactive visuals. I used Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree Classifier, and Support Vector Machine to predict the success of a future landing process. StandardScaler(), train_test_split(), and GridSearchCV() functions from sklearn were also used for hyperparameter optimization and accuracy calculation.
